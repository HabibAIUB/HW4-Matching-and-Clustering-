    "#### The time complexity of the provided code is exponential, specifically O(2^n), where n is the length of the marks_list. This analysis is based on the recursive nature of the iterative_call function.\n",
    "#### Let's break down the reasons for this time complexity:\n",
    "#### Recursive Calls:</br>The function iterative_call is called recursively for each possible path in the decision tree. In the worst case, for each mark in the marks_list, a new recursive call is made. Since there are 2^n possible subsets of marks (including the empty subset and the full subset), the total number of recursive calls becomes exponential.\n",
    "#### Memoization: </br>Although memoization is used to store and retrieve already computed results in the solved_subproblems dictionary, it doesn't change the fundamental nature of the algorithm. Memoization helps avoid redundant calculations, but the worst-case time complexity remains exponential.\n",
    "#### Subproblem Size:</br>For each recursive call, the size of the subproblem decreases by 1 (due to the removal of one mark from the marks_list). However, the number of subproblems is still exponential, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(2^n).\n",
    "#### The exponential time complexity suggests that the algorithm may become inefficient for larger inputs, as the number of computations grows rapidly with the size of the marks_list. Considerations for optimizing the algorithm further, perhaps through dynamic programming or a more efficient algorithmic approach, would be advisable for handling larger inputs efficiently."
